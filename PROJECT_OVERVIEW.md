## 🎨 Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Messaging
- **Serious but Memey**: We're a revolution, but we don't take ourselves too seriously
- **Powerful**: Every word conveys strength and inevitability
- **Inclusive**: "The People" - everyone is invited to join
- **Transparent**: Full disclosure of tokenomics and mechanics
- **Actionable**: Every page has clear CTAs

### Writing Guidelines
- Use active, commanding voice
- Employ financial/legal terminology ironically
- Reference "the elite" and "the people" dichotomy
- Emphasize transparency and fairness
- Include subtle memecoin humor

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- No sensitive data stored
- No user authentication (yet)
- All data is mock/frontend-only
- No API calls to external services

### When Adding Web3
- Use reputable wallet connection libraries
- Never store private keys
- Implement proper transaction signing
- Add slippage protection
- Include MEV protection where applicable
- Audit all smart contract interactions

---

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

```
Mobile:    320px - 767px   (single column, stacked)
Tablet:    768px - 1023px  (2 columns where appropriate)
Desktop:   1024px - 1919px (full layout)
Large:     1920px+         (max-width container)
```

All components are fully responsive using Tailwind's breakpoint system.

---

## 🎨 CSS Architecture

### Utility Classes
Custom utilities defined in `index.css`:
- `.text-glow`: Glowing text effect
- `.btn-taxman`: Branded button style with hover effects
- `.grid-bg`: Tron-style grid background

### Animation Strategy
- Framer Motion for page/component animations
- CSS transitions for simple hover states
- Transform-based animations for performance
- Will-change hints for heavy animations

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Mock Data**: All metrics and wallets are simulated
2. **No Backend**: Everything runs client-side
3. **Sound Library**: Procedural sounds (no audio files)
4. **Chart Data**: Static/simulated price data
5. **Leaderboard**: Not persisted across sessions

These are intentional for the demo/prototype phase.
